% â€¢ Brief summary of the project proposal (max 200 words)
Load-balancing, as applied to the web application context, seems to have yet to be revolutionised by parallel developments in software-defined networking (SDN), with most load-balancing still occurring on dedicated hardware or dedicated software on generic hardware \cite{market_share}. \\

This proposal explores the relevant background required to understand these two complementary technologies and how they could potentially be combined to make more efficient use of resources by implementing load-balancing at the network level, using the Open Network Operating System (ONOS) SDN controller \cite{onos_repo}. This proposed load-balancer would be able take advantage of various load-balancing algorithms in a modular fashion. Once implemented, this load-balancer will be tested against different traffic profiles to determine which algorithms best suit each profile. \\

Work has already begun to achieve these goals, including the development of test network infrastructure, a sample web application, selection of load-balancing algorithms, and the identification of relevant ONOS APIs required for the development of a load-balancing controller application.
