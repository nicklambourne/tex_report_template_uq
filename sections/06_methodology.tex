\section{Methodology} \label{sec:method}
% â€¢ You should provide a brief discussion of the approach, methods, tools that you will use in your project. For example, you can specify that you will use Mininet as your experimental test-bed. At this stage, you might not know which platform or tools you will use, e.g. you might not know yet which controller platform you will use. You can mention that as well, and say that one of the project tasks is to explore the different controllers.
