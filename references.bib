	abstract = {Cloud computing is a modern paradigm to provide services through the Internet. Load balancing is a key aspect of cloud computing and avoids the situation in which some nodes become overloaded while the others are idle or have little work to do. Load balancing can improve the Quality of Service (QoS) metrics, including response time, cost, throughput, performance and resource utilization.},
